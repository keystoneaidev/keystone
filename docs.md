## **How It Works**  

### **1. Create a Token Profile**  
Users begin by providing fundamental details about their project, including:  
- Project name and token ticker  
- Total supply and distribution model  
- Governance structure and intended utility  

### **2. AI-Generated Refinement**  
Keystone AI processes the provided information and generates:  
- A comprehensive token profile with optimized tokenomics  
- A structured roadmap based on similar successful projects  
- Branding elements, including logo and messaging suggestions  

Users have the ability to modify and refine AI-generated suggestions before finalizing their submission.  

### **3. Submission to the Keystone Token List**  
Upon completion, the project is published to the Keystone AI token list, where it becomes available for community review and voting.  

- $KEY token holders can review and assess projects.  
- Community engagement determines the visibility and credibility of projects.  
- Highly ranked projects receive additional exposure and potential access to funding opportunities.  

### **4. Governance and Voting**  
$KEY holders vote on submitted projects, influencing their ranking and visibility.  
- More votes correlate with higher positioning on the platform.  
- Users can stake $KEY to gain increased governance influence.  
- The system ensures that only well-structured, viable projects receive priority attention.
