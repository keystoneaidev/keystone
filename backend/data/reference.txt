Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms:

Proof of Work (PoW) - Secure but energy-intensive.

Proof of Stake (PoS) - More efficient, staking-based validation.

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) - Faster, uses delegates for block validation.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) - Used in Hyperledger, Cosmos.

Proof of Authority (PoA) - Centralized, identity-based consensus.

Smart Contract Security Risks:

Reentrancy Attacks - Functions calling themselves before execution completes.

Integer Overflow & Underflow - Arithmetic errors leading to unintended behavior.

Front-running - Exploiting transaction order to gain advantage.

Unchecked External Calls - Calling untrusted contracts without validation.

Default Visibility - Functions defaulting to public when intended to be private.

Token Standards:

ERC-20 - Standard fungible token.

ERC-721 - Non-fungible token (NFT) standard.

ERC-1155 - Multi-token standard allowing fungible and non-fungible in one contract.

BEP-20 - Binance Smart Chain equivalent of ERC-20.

Common API Endpoints:

/api/predict - Predicts blockchain market trends.

/api/transaction/{tx_hash} - Fetches transaction details.

/api/address/{wallet_address} - Retrieves wallet balances and history.

/api/smartcontract/{contract_address} - Analyzes smart contract security.

/api/marketdata - Provides market insights from multiple chains.

Key Blockchain Metrics:

Hash Rate - Computational power securing the network.

Transaction Throughput - Measured in TPS (transactions per second).
